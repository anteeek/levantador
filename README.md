Native Android application attempt. Built with Java, React Native and React Native Paper. It's an alarm clock that has 3 modes:
 * Classic alarm (Just select time and trust the application it fires)
 * QR-code alarm (Same as classic alarm, but the user has to scan a QR code in order to switch the alarm off)
 * Location-based alarm (select a place, and it will wake you up when you are 5 kilometers from that place, or when your speed & distance are indicating that you will reach it in i.e. 5 minutes) (Shown above in the gif)

 Please note that it's not fully functional yet, don't trust it to actually wake you up every time. 
 To do:
  * Persist alarms when restarting the device
